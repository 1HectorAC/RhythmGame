# Basic Rhythm Game

## Summary

This is a basic rhythm game where these little round things drop and the player has to hit the right note as it crosses the bottom bar. You get points for hiting the notes on time which is displayed on the top left corner. There are also two side bars on the left and right side of the screen that you can control. They can only move vertically and if you align them both to the randomly placed star on its path then you get bonus points. High scores are saved and displayed on end screen.
